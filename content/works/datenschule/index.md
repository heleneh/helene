While data becomes increasingly available, civil society organisations are struggling to build capacity to work with data and understand alleged or factual risks.

[Datenschule](ttps://datenschule.de) (School of Data Germany) seeks to help non-profit organisations and activists to understand and use data responsibly in order to increase their impact on existing societal challenges. The programme offers hands-on data training and empowers non-profit organisations to build evidence-based campaigns with dedicated data practitioners and community members.

Have a look at [The StoryHunt](../storyhunt), [JedeSchule (Every School)](../jedeschule), [OffenesParlament (Open Parliament)](../offenesparlament) to learn more about our activities and discover how data can be used by civil society actors.

Datenschule is part of the international [School of Data](https://schoolofdata.org/), a network of data practitioners and trainers working on empowering civil society organisations with skills and knowledge they need to use data effectively.

From 2016 to 2018, I led and developed this programme with my colleagues at the Open Knowledge Foundation Germany.
