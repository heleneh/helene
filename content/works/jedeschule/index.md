[JedeSchule.de](https://jedeschule.de) (Every School) explores the accessibility of school information made available by the Statistical Offices of Germany’s federal states. It is an information and research platform that advocates for more transparency within the educational system.

This project provides an overview of more than 30.000 schools across 16 federal states along with comprehensive statistics and analysis of out-of-school activities, school partnerships and budget spending. 

Following our campaign and with the engagement of the local civic tech community, we liberated [information on schools in Hesse](https://datenschule.de/blog/2017/07/DS-JedeSchule-Hessen) (formally available by purchase only) and made it re-usable for everyone [here](https://jedeschule.de/daten). Our lessons learnt on existing flaws regarding access to information can be found [here](https://datenschule.de/blog/2017/08/schuldaten-bundeslaender-check-fazit). 

JedeSchule.de is a project I led and designed with Datenschule and BildungsCent e.V. It was featured by Govdata.de, Deutschlandradio and detector.fm.
